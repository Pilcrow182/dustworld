Instant Cabin (instacabin) mod for Minetest


by thefamilygrog66

Description:
An instant cabin that, when given to a player, can be placed anywhere for shelter from mobs. It's based on parts of the code for the WorldEdit mod by sfan5 - mainly the "deserialize" section - and can only be used once (i.e. the player cannot pick it up in one piece and then place it somewhere else). Since it uses code from WorldEdit, it's compatible with other structures saved using the most recent version of that mod; simply copy the .we file of your choice from the schems folder in your world folder, and then paste it in the instacabin/models/ folder, rename it to cabin.we, and restart Minetest.

Recipe:

(note: there is no recipe as of yet - admins/owners will need to give players a cabin using the /give playername instacabin:cabin command.

Mod dependencies: default, stairs, wool
