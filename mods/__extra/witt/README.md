# WiTT
What is This Thing, a Minetest mod that functions similarly to the WAILA mod for Minecraft.
Currently there are two ways to use this mod: The server way and the client way. 
The server way is what you should do when playing singleplayer, just take the master branch and put it in your mods/ directory.
The client way is what you should do when playing on a server that does not have WiTT installed. Take the `csm` branch and put it in your clientmods/ directory, then enable it.
If you are using the client way, you will need to use the command `.witt`

A video of the mod at version 1 (server mode, pre-initial commit) is available [here](https://youtu.be/dfIfj8nrCQg).
